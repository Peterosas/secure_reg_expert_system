# SecureRegExpertSystem

**SecureRegExpertSystem** - A Flask-based application that evaluates user data against rules to classify them into different tiers based on fraud risk.

## Description

This project provides a user registration system that applies an expert system to classify users based on predefined rules. The system evaluates user data (email, age, country, income) and classifies the user as either `Good` or `Fraudster`. Based on the score, users are assigned a `Tier` (low, medium, or high).
